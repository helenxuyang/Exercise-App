# Exercise-App
An Android app that gamifies exercise, very much a work in progress

Over winter break, I started making an app that gamifies exercise so that I could learn how to use Android Studio (and eventually force myself to exercise). The app is very much a work in progress, but as of now you can enter exercises onto a list along with a range of time or repetitions that you can complete, and the app generates tasks from those exercises to create a workout. For example, if I added jogging (10-20 minutes) and curl-ups (10-30 repetitions), the workout might generate “jogging - 12 minutes” or “curl-ups: 27 repetitions.” The workout itself is designed to be like a quest where you deal damage to a boss with every task you complete, because I personally hate exercising but would find it a bit more fun if working out was like a game.

Although I was mostly just following tutorials for SQLite and how to use RecyclerView, I was really happy to get the two connected so that I could store data in more flexible ways than just using SharedPreferences. Even if the app isn’t much right now, I was excited to take my first step in learning about app development, and I hope to keep learning more as I continue working on it.
